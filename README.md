# Unemployment Rate Analysis with Python

As part of my Data Science internship at InternPedia, I undertook an insightful project focused on analyzing unemployment trends, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This project allowed me to delve into real-world data, uncovering significant patterns and insights.

**Project Highlights:**

Objective: Analyze unemployment data to understand trends and identify key factors contributing to unemployment rates, especially during the pandemic.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Key Techniques: Data cleaning, time series analysis, trend identification, and visualization of unemployment patterns.

**What I Learned:**

1. The importance of time series analysis in tracking economic indicators over different periods.

2. How to handle and clean large datasets, ensuring accurate and meaningful analysis.

3. Techniques for visualizing complex data in an accessible and insightful way, making it easier to communicate findings.

**Outcome:**

By analyzing the unemployment data, I was able to identify key trends and correlations, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different demographics. The visualizations created provided clear insights into how unemployment rates fluctuated during this period.

**Grateful for the Experience:**

A huge thanks to the InternPedia team for this incredible opportunity. This project has significantly enhanced my data analysis skills and has given me a deeper understanding of how data science can be applied to real-world economic issues.
